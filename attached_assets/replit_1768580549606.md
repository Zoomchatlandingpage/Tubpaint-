# Project Factory - Cognitive Agent System Dashboard

## Overview

Project Factory is a multi-agent cognitive system dashboard for managing projects from concept to launch. The application provides a visual interface for orchestrating autonomous AI agents that work through defined project phases, with a structured knowledge pipeline for learning and validation.

The system implements a formal cognitive architecture with:
- **Multi-agent orchestration** - 10 specialized agents (AG-0 through AG-9) handling different aspects of project execution
- **Phase-based workflow** - Projects progress through Ideation, Market Research, Development, Testing/QA, and Launch phases
- **Knowledge pipeline** - Structured intake, processing, validation, and storage of learned information following defined axioms

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens for dark-themed dashboard
- **Build Tool**: Vite with path aliases (@/, @shared/, @assets/)

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful endpoints under /api/ prefix
- **Build**: esbuild for server bundling, Vite for client

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Location**: shared/schema.ts (shared between client and server)
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit with migrations in /migrations folder

### Core Data Models
- **Projects**: Main entities with phases, progress tracking, and status
- **Phases**: Workflow stages with assigned agents and completion status
- **Agents**: Autonomous workers with types (orchestrator, strategic, execution, quality)
- **Knowledge**: Validated learning items with confidence scoring
- **Intake/Processing/Validation/Rejected**: Pipeline stages for knowledge management
- **Conversations/Messages**: Chat functionality with AI integration
- **ProjectSources**: Track imported projects from GitHub or local directories
- **AgentPrinciples**: Versioned principles learned by agents with confidence scores
- **AgentRuns/AgentActions**: Execution history with token usage and costs
- **AuditEvents**: Complete audit trail of all system actions
- **TrendIntel**: Market and technology trends discovered by AI

### AI Integration Layer
Located in server/services/:
- **ai-client.ts**: Unified interface for Claude Sonnet and GPT-4o with streaming
- **agent-orchestrator.ts**: AG-0 orchestrates tasks, delegates to specialized agents, tracks costs
- **project-discovery.ts**: Scans Replit workspace and GitHub repos, detects tech stack and phase
- **trend-discovery.ts**: AI-powered trend discovery that updates agent principles

### Key Features (January 2026)
- **GitHub Integration**: OAuth connector for scanning repositories and importing projects
- **Project Discovery**: Automatic detection of project phase (Ideation, Research, Development, Testing, Launch)
- **Agent Execution**: Real AI execution with Claude/GPT-4o, cost tracking per run
- **Self-Update System**: Agents learn from trends and update their principles with versioning
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all agent actions and system events

### Design System
- Dark theme primary with light mode support
- Color-coded status indicators (emerald=active, amber=in-progress, zinc=idle, red=error)
- Gradient accents (violet to fuchsia) for branding
- Monospace fonts for technical precision
